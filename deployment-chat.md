I want to deploy my portfolio site, which has backend in spring and frontend in react, it will use mysql, and some storage space to store files like .txt.
I don't expect much traffic on this, but want the availabilty to be high.

How can I deploy this free of charge, I do not want to pay anything, as there will hardly be any visitors.

Deploying a full-stack application with a Spring backend, React frontend, MySQL database, and file storage for free can be challenging, but there are still ways to make it work with some limitations. You will likely need to leverage multiple free-tier services, as no single provider offers everything you need for free, especially with higher availability guarantees. Here's a possible solution using free-tier services for each component:

1. Frontend (React) Deployment
   You can deploy the React frontend using static hosting services, which offer free plans.

Vercel: Easy deployment for static sites and frontend frameworks like React. Vercel offers free hosting with automatic scaling.

How to deploy: Simply connect your GitHub repository, and it will automatically build and deploy the React app.
Pros: Free tier with good performance, automatic deployments.
Limitations: Free tier has limited serverless function execution time and may have daily limits, but React itself will only need to serve static files.
Netlify: Another excellent choice for static site deployment. It's free and integrates well with GitHub.

How to deploy: Similar to Vercel, connect your GitHub repository, and Netlify will handle the build and deployment.
Pros: Free tier is generous with deployments, includes CI/CD, custom domains, and SSL. 2. Backend (Spring Boot) Deployment
For the Spring Boot backend, you can use platforms that offer free hosting with some limitations on traffic, resources, and uptime.

Railway: Railway offers a simple way to deploy backend services for free. The free plan includes limited uptime, so it’s not always guaranteed to be online, but should work for low-traffic apps.

How to deploy: You can deploy your Spring Boot application directly from a GitHub repository to Railway. The backend will run as a web service.
Pros: Free tier includes 512MB RAM and 1GB storage for databases, with automatic scaling. Supports Docker, Java, and Node.js.
Limitations: Free tier comes with restrictions, such as "sleep" mode after a period of inactivity.
Heroku: Heroku offers a free tier that supports Java apps, but there are limitations such as your app "sleeping" after 30 minutes of inactivity and limited request handling.

How to deploy: Push your Spring Boot app to Heroku via Git, and the platform will automatically deploy and run it.
Pros: Free tier is easy to use with continuous deployment from GitHub, supports Java (Spring Boot).
Limitations: The free tier comes with limitations, including sleeping dynos and a limited number of hours per day that your app can be online (550 hours/month). 3. Database (MySQL) Deployment
For MySQL, there are several free-tier database services that you can use. These are generally limited in storage and query capacity, but should be sufficient for low-traffic applications.

PlanetScale: A highly scalable, serverless MySQL-compatible database that offers a free tier with 5GB of storage and 100GB of data transfer per month.

Pros: Free tier includes automatic scaling, good performance, and MySQL compatibility.
Limitations: Limited to the free tier features, but it should be sufficient for small apps.
Free MySQL Hosting: Providers like Heliohost offer free MySQL hosting, though they may come with slow speeds or downtime.

Pros: Totally free.
Limitations: Limited resources, so not as reliable as other options. The uptime might not be ideal for production use.
ElephantSQL: If you don’t mind PostgreSQL, ElephantSQL offers a free tier with 20MB of storage. It’s a good alternative if MySQL is not a strict requirement.

Pros: Free tier, good support, easy integration.
Limitations: 20MB storage, not MySQL. 4. File Storage
For storing files like .txt or other media files, you can use cloud storage providers with generous free tiers.

GitHub Storage (for small files): You can use GitHub's releases feature or even store files directly in your repo if they are small. For example, small .txt files or configurations can be stored in your repository and fetched from there.

Pros: Free, no additional configuration needed.
Limitations: Not ideal for large files or high traffic.
Google Cloud Storage: Google Cloud offers a 5GB free storage with its free tier, which should be sufficient for small apps with minimal file storage needs.

Pros: Good reliability and storage capacity.
Limitations: Limited to 5GB, and there are potential API rate limits if you get more usage.
AWS S3 Free Tier: AWS offers 5GB of standard storage and 20,000 GET requests per month in the free tier.

Pros: Large free tier, reliable storage.
Limitations: Limited to 5GB.
Cloudflare R2: Cloudflare offers free object storage with unlimited egress, which is a great option for file storage.

Pros: Unlimited egress, cheap or free storage.
Limitations: May need some configuration to integrate into your app.
Architecture Overview:
Frontend (React): Host on Vercel or Netlify.
Backend (Spring Boot): Host on Railway or Heroku.
Database (MySQL): Use PlanetScale for MySQL or ElephantSQL if you're fine with PostgreSQL.
File Storage: Use Google Cloud Storage, S3 or Cloudflare R2 for storing .txt files.
Important Considerations:
Uptime: Free-tier services often have limitations like limited uptime or the app going to sleep after a period of inactivity. You may need to configure your application to wake up periodically or handle downtime gracefully.
Traffic: Free services are designed for low to moderate traffic. If you expect more visitors in the future, you’ll need to migrate to a paid plan.
Performance: Free-tier resources can be limited in terms of CPU, RAM, and database performance. Monitor your app’s performance and scale if necessary.
Summary:
Frontend: Vercel or Netlify
Backend: Railway or Heroku
Database: PlanetScale (MySQL) or ElephantSQL (PostgreSQL)
File Storage: Google Cloud Storage, S3, or Cloudflare R2
By leveraging these free-tier services, you should be able to deploy your portfolio site without any costs while maintaining reasonable availability and performance.

GitHub Storage (for small files)

Amazing catch, why didnt I think of that those .txt files are actually p5js sketches that I want to dynamically show in the frontend, since they are already on my github I don't need this functionality at all!!!

Also, i read microsoft azure provides some services for free always, with some conditions, which once reach will incur charges, but I don't think this will be the case. Can you elaborate on this too.
ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely right—if the .txt files are already on your GitHub, you don’t need to worry about additional storage services. You can directly fetch and display them from your GitHub repository, making the deployment much simpler and avoiding the need for separate storage. This is a great solution, especially since your sketches are relatively small in size and don’t require complex storage solutions.

Now, regarding Microsoft Azure: Yes, Azure does offer a very generous free tier for various services, which can be ideal for low-traffic and low-resource apps like your portfolio site. Let me break down how Azure’s free services work and what you should keep in mind.

Microsoft Azure Free Services
Azure’s free tier offers a mix of always free services and 12-month free services (which are free for the first 12 months, after which they start charging). Here’s a breakdown of some key free offerings from Azure:

1. Azure App Services (Web Hosting)
   Always Free: Azure provides a free App Service plan (F1 tier), which allows you to host your web applications. This plan is suitable for small apps with low traffic.
   Limitations:

1GB of disk space.
Up to 60 minutes of compute time per day.
Apps might go to sleep during periods of inactivity (like the free tier of Heroku or Railway).
Limited CPU and memory resources.
How this helps: You can use this to deploy your Spring Boot backend and serve your React frontend as static files or through a Node.js proxy, all within the free tier. This should be sufficient for a personal portfolio with low traffic.

2. Azure Functions
   Always Free: Azure Functions are serverless compute resources that let you run backend code in response to HTTP requests. The free plan offers up to 1 million requests and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.
   Limitations:

Limited resources for compute, but this is often enough for small apps or APIs with low traffic.
Cold starts can affect performance if there are long periods of inactivity.
How this helps: If you need some backend logic (e.g., API routes for your React frontend), you can use Azure Functions to run Java code (Spring Boot can also be deployed on Azure Functions using Java runtime). For your low-traffic app, this should be sufficient.

3. Azure Database for MySQL
   12-Month Free: Azure offers a 12-month free tier for the Azure Database for MySQL service, which includes up to 250MB of storage and 1 GB of backup storage.
   Limitations: After the 12 months, this service will start charging based on storage and compute. If your MySQL database stays small, you may continue to stay within the free tier for a while.

How this helps: You can deploy MySQL for free in Azure for 12 months, which could work well for your project. After the 12 months, you can assess whether you need to switch to a paid plan or find an alternative free service like PlanetScale.

4. Azure Blob Storage
   Always Free: Azure offers 5GB of Blob Storage for free as part of its Azure Storage service.
   Limitations: The free tier includes 5GB of storage, and charges apply once you exceed that amount or use other advanced storage features.

How this helps: If your application grows and you need to store more than just the .txt files (e.g., media files, user uploads), you can use Azure Blob Storage for file storage. However, for now, if you’re only dealing with small .txt files, you might still be fine with GitHub storage or the 5GB free tier.

5. Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network)
   Always Free: Azure’s Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers 1TB of outbound data transfer per month.
   Limitations: This includes 1TB of data, which is more than enough for small apps with low traffic.

How this helps: If you decide to serve static assets like images, JS, and CSS files (or even the .txt sketches), you could leverage the Azure CDN to cache these files close to your users, improving load times.

6. Azure Cognitive Services (for optional AI)
   Always Free: If you want to integrate any AI capabilities in the future (like text analysis, image recognition, etc.), Azure Cognitive Services offers a free tier for each API with limited usage.
   Limitations: Usage limits vary by API, but it’s great for experimentation or adding advanced features.
   Summary of How Azure Can Help for Your Project:
   Frontend Deployment: Use Azure App Services (F1 tier) to host your React frontend.
   Backend Deployment: Host your Spring Boot backend on Azure App Services or use Azure Functions for a serverless approach.
   Database: Use the 12-month free tier of Azure Database for MySQL or consider PlanetScale for MySQL compatibility, especially after the first year.
   File Storage: If you need to scale beyond GitHub storage, use Azure Blob Storage for up to 5GB free.
   Content Delivery: Use Azure CDN to improve performance and reduce latency, with 1TB of free data transfer.
   When Will Charges Start?
   The free tiers from Azure are quite generous, especially for a low-traffic portfolio site. Charges will start when you exceed the free limits for any service, such as:

Exceeding storage limits (e.g., for MySQL or Blob Storage).
Exceeding compute time for App Services or Azure Functions.
Going beyond the free data transfer limits for CDN.
However, since you expect low traffic and small file sizes, it’s unlikely you’ll reach these thresholds quickly, especially if you monitor usage and keep everything small and lean.

How to Avoid Unexpected Charges:
Monitor Usage: Set up alerts in the Azure portal to notify you when you're nearing the free-tier limits.
Scale Down Resources: Ensure you’re only using the minimal resources you need. Azure allows you to scale up or down, so you can stay within the free tier limits.
Set Spending Caps: Azure allows you to set a spending cap on your account. This ensures that even if you go beyond the free tier, you won’t incur charges until you manually adjust the settings.
Conclusion:
Azure's free-tier services provide a strong set of tools to deploy your project with little to no cost, especially if your traffic is low. You can host the backend (Spring Boot), frontend (React), MySQL database, and even store files, all under Azure’s free offerings for the first 12 months or indefinitely (with some limits). This could be a great option for your project if you prefer a more unified platform that scales as needed.

Given your use case, combining GitHub storage for the .txt sketches with Azure’s free tiers should be more than enough to deploy your portfolio site without worrying about charges for the foreseeable future.

Great, it sounds like you have a solid plan for deploying your full-stack app! Here's how you can proceed with your choices:

1. Frontend Deployment on Netlify
   Netlify is a fantastic choice for deploying static sites like React apps. It's easy to use and fully integrates with GitHub, so each time you push to your repo, Netlify will automatically build and deploy your React frontend.
   Steps:
   Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
   Choose the correct build settings (e.g., build command: npm run build, publish directory: build/).
   Once configured, Netlify will handle the deployment and give you a live URL. You can also connect a custom domain if you want.
2. Backend Deployment on Azure Functions
   Azure Functions is a great way to run your backend in a serverless environment. While traditionally Spring Boot is used with a more "traditional" server, you can certainly deploy it to Azure Functions using the Java runtime.
   How it works: Azure Functions allows you to write backend logic as small serverless functions. You can expose HTTP endpoints, process background tasks, and run business logic within these functions. For a Spring Boot application, you would typically run the backend inside a function, and it’s perfect for handling API requests or small-scale applications.

Steps to deploy Spring Boot to Azure Functions:

Create an Azure Functions project with the Java runtime (using Maven or Gradle).
Configure the function to use HTTP triggers (i.e., your API endpoints).
Deploy the project to Azure Functions (via GitHub Actions, Azure CLI, or Maven plugin).
Set up Azure Functions to trigger these Spring Boot functions when API calls are made.
Important Notes:

Azure Functions can be used for small, event-driven tasks like API calls. If your backend requires persistent state or complex services (e.g., managing sessions, large services, etc.), Azure App Service may be a better choice for long-running applications. However, for simple API handling, Azure Functions will work well. 3. Database on Azure SQL Database
Azure offers a serverless SQL Database that fits your needs. The serverless tier in Azure SQL Database is perfect for low-traffic apps because it automatically scales compute resources based on demand, and you only pay for the resources you use.

Free Tier: The free serverless SQL database tier offers:

100,000 vCore-seconds per month.
32 GB storage.
This should be sufficient for small apps or low-traffic sites. If you expect your database to remain small and don’t anticipate high usage, you should be able to stay within the free tier for quite a while.

Steps to deploy Azure SQL Database:
Go to Azure Portal and create a new Azure SQL Database.
Choose the Serverless tier and configure your database (you can start with a small size and scale as needed).
Set up connection strings in your Spring Boot application to point to your Azure SQL Database. 4. File Storage on GitHub
If your .txt files are already on GitHub and you don’t need to store a lot of large files, you can directly use GitHub to serve those files by fetching them via the GitHub API or by simply linking to them in your React app.
Steps:
Ensure your .txt files are stored in a public repository on GitHub.
Fetch them in your React app using the GitHub raw file URL (you can use fetch() to get the file content).
Display them as needed in your app.
Setting Spending Caps on Azure
Azure allows you to set a spending cap to prevent unexpected charges, but this feature is available only for Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions. If you are on a free-tier or Azure for Students subscription, the cap may not be necessary, as your resources will not exceed the free-tier limits.

How to set spending caps:

Go to Azure Portal: Log in to the Azure Portal.
Navigate to Subscriptions: In the left-hand menu, click on Subscriptions.
Choose Your Subscription: Select the subscription for which you want to set the spending cap.
Go to "Cost Management + Billing": Find and click on Cost Management + Billing.
Set Spending Cap:
Under the Cost Management section, look for the Budgets option.
You can create a Budget that will alert you when your spending reaches a certain limit. While you can set alerts, the actual spending cap that fully prevents charges is only available for specific subscription types.
Set Alerts: You can configure the system to notify you at different spending thresholds, ensuring you know when you are nearing your budget.
Monitoring: Azure offers detailed reporting on your current usage, and you can set up email notifications or SMS alerts when your spending reaches a defined threshold.
How Spending Caps Work:
Alert System: While you can’t fully disable services once you reach your cap (for most subscription types), Azure will alert you as you approach your spending limits, so you can monitor and adjust.
Subscription Type: The cap system works best for Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions, and Azure free accounts don’t incur charges until you surpass the free-tier limits. You will be notified when you’re close to the free tier’s limits, giving you time to react before any charges occur.
Free Credits: For Azure for Students or Azure free accounts, you may get a certain amount of free credits each month or year. These credits are automatically applied to your account, and when they’re used up, you may receive notifications before being switched to a pay-as-you-go model.
To Summarize:
Frontend (React): Deploy on Netlify (it’s free and simple to use).
Backend (Spring Boot): Use Azure Functions (you can deploy Java functions and expose HTTP APIs).
Database: Use Azure SQL Database (serverless) for free tier, with up to 100,000 vCore-seconds and 32GB storage.
File Storage: Store and serve .txt files directly from your GitHub repository.
Spending Cap: You can set up a budget and alert system in Azure to monitor and manage your spending, but spending caps in a strict sense are available for Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions (not on free-tier plans).
This setup should allow you to deploy your app at no cost for the foreseeable future, and you’ll be able to monitor your usage easily to ensure you don't incur charges unexpectedly.

I want to fetch these files as well does github provide any API to do that?
ChatGPT said:

Yes, GitHub provides an API that allows you to fetch raw files from a public repository. This API is very useful for fetching text files like your .txt sketches, and it works well in a frontend application (e.g., in your React app).

Here’s how you can fetch a raw file from GitHub using the GitHub API:

1. GitHub API for Raw Files
   To fetch the raw content of a file (like .txt files) from a GitHub repository, you can use the raw.githubusercontent.com URL format, or you can use the GitHub REST API.

Option 1: Using the raw.githubusercontent.com URL
GitHub automatically provides raw URLs for files stored in a public repository. You can directly access the raw file by using the following format:

php
Copy code
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repository>/<branch>/<path_to_file>
username: Your GitHub username.
repository: The name of the repository where the file is stored.
branch: The branch where the file resides (typically main or master).
path_to_file: The relative path of the file inside the repository.
Example:
Let’s say you have a .txt file called sketch1.txt in a public repository, and it’s in the main branch. The URL to access the raw content would look like this:

arduino
Copy code
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo-name/main/sketch1.txt
You can fetch this file using a simple HTTP request in JavaScript (e.g., in your React app).

Example Code (Using Fetch in React):
javascript
Copy code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const SketchViewer = ({ fileName }) => {
const [fileContent, setFileContent] = useState('');
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
const fetchFile = async () => {
setLoading(true);
try {
const response = await fetch(`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo-name/main/${fileName}`);
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error('File not found');
}
const text = await response.text();
setFileContent(text);
} catch (error) {
console.error('Error fetching file:', error);
setFileContent('Error loading file');
} finally {
setLoading(false);
}
};

    fetchFile();

}, [fileName]);

return (
<div>
{loading ? (
<p>Loading...</p>
) : (
<pre>{fileContent}</pre>
)}
</div>
);
};

export default SketchViewer;
In this example:

The fileName is passed as a prop to the component, and the file is fetched from the GitHub repository.
The content is displayed using the <pre> tag to preserve formatting (especially useful for code and text files).
Option 2: Using GitHub API (REST API)
GitHub also provides a REST API to fetch raw content from a file. This can be useful if you want to interact with GitHub programmatically for additional metadata (like commit history or file information).

To fetch the content of a file using GitHub's REST API, you would use an endpoint like this:

php
Copy code
GET https://api.github.com/repos/<username>/<repository>/contents/<path_to_file>
This will return a JSON object containing the file's metadata and a base64-encoded content field.

Example Request:
javascript
Copy code
const fetchFile = async () => {
const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/your-username/your-repo-name/contents/sketch1.txt`);
const data = await response.json();

// Decode the base64 content
const decodedContent = atob(data.content); // Decodes from base64
setFileContent(decodedContent);
};
In this example:

The content of sketch1.txt is fetched from the GitHub API.
The base64-encoded content is returned in the content field, and you can use atob() to decode it into readable text.
Pros and Cons of the Two Methods:
Option 1 (raw.githubusercontent.com URL):
Pros:
Simple and straightforward.
No need for authentication (for public repos).
Direct access to raw file content.
Cons:
Does not provide metadata (like file size, last commit, etc.).
Can be rate-limited if you make too many requests in a short period.
Option 2 (GitHub REST API):
Pros:
Provides metadata, such as file size, last updated time, and more.
Can be used for more complex scenarios (e.g., listing multiple files or interacting with repositories).
Cons:
The file content is base64-encoded, so you need to decode it.
Requires more processing (compared to using the raw URL).
Might hit rate limits if you're making a lot of requests.
Authentication for API Requests (Optional)
While you don’t need authentication for public repositories when fetching raw files, GitHub imposes rate limits on unauthenticated API requests. If you plan on making many API calls (or for private repositories), you might want to authenticate your API requests.

Authentication with a Personal Access Token: You can generate a personal access token (PAT) on GitHub and use it to authenticate your API requests to avoid rate-limiting.
Here’s an example of using authentication with a token:

javascript
Copy code
const fetchFile = async () => {
const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/your-username/your-repo-name/contents/sketch1.txt`, {
headers: {
'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN',
}
});
const data = await response.json();
const decodedContent = atob(data.content);
setFileContent(decodedContent);
};
This would allow you to authenticate and bypass the rate limits for unauthenticated requests.

Conclusion
GitHub provides a very straightforward way to fetch raw files, either by using the raw.githubusercontent.com URL or the GitHub REST API. For simple fetching of .txt files in your case, the raw URL approach is the easiest and most efficient.

You can integrate this into your React frontend to display the content of your .txt sketches dynamically.
